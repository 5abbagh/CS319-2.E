INTRODUCTION


	The project group decides to implement an arcade game because arcade games has an advantage which is the models can be drawn 
	easily than the other programs. Thus, we decided to create a game which is combination of “Pacman" and “Bomberman”. We decided 		to implement a stealth game "Maze Runner" that combines these two games and offers many new features. It will give you the 		present enjoyment of gaming plus the lovely nostalgia to the old days. The game can be played as a single player or multi-player 	and the game purpose is to reach the end as soon as possible.

	The goal of our game is to solve a sophisticated maze as fast as possible with the least possible attraction of soldiers. Both
	single and multi-player modes can plant a bomb and tries to keep the patrols out of your way or damage your enemy(in multi-		player version). When the player reaches the end, he will receive bonus points with respect to remaining time. 

	Overview section includes more details about the content of the project. The report contains overview, functional requirements, 
	nonfunctional requirements and use case model chapters. The following chapter is overview that gives more information about
	the game.
	

	Overview
	The game consists of a Pac-man like moving object which goal is to finish the maze as soon as possible without being killed by 
	the soldiers which are continuosly moving around and trying to stop the player from reaching the exit of the maze. The player 		has abilities that help him escape from the soldiers when he is very close to them. The game has a time limit and also there are         time related features of the bombs. 
        The game can be paused and continued where it was left afterwards. A high score system will be accessible allowing the player to         check his last five scores. 
        In both arcade and multiplayer versions the game will be played by using the keyboard. Player can access the help menu to get           instructions on how to play the game.
        
	2.1.  Play Mode
	Single player  mode: In the arcade mode the player’s goal is to reach to the exit as soon as possible. There will be the 		soldiers trying to stop him and the challenge is going to be finishing the maze before the time ends. The player can get rid of 	the soldiers by throwing bombs to them but needs to escape in a short amount of time from the explosion range
	Multiplayer mode: In this mode there is not a time limit to finish the game but the challenge is finishing before your opponent. 	 The game is won from the player who made it first to the exit or if any of the players got killed then the other player wins the 	  game.
	2.2. Bomb Types
	Own area: This kind of bomb is dropped in the current position of the player and has a small explosion area and the target is 		the soldiers. It has an explosion time of 5 seconds which is enough for the player to escape from the explosion range. There 		will be an unlimited number of such bombs available to the player and killing 2 or more soldiers wins you another kind of bomb 		which you can throw in the opponent’s area when in multiplayer mode.
	Opponent area: This kind of bomb differs from the other type because it is used to kill your opponent and resets the opponent’s 	position to the beginning position. The player unlocks this bomb if he has killed two or more soldiers in his area by using 		normal bombs.
