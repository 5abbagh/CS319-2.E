INTRODUCTION


	The project group decides to implement an arcade game because arcade games has an advantage which is the models can be drawn 
	easily than the other programs. Thus, we decided to create a game which is combination of “Pacman" and “Bomberman”. We decided to
	implement a stealth game "Maze Runner" that combines these two games and offers many new features. It will give you the present
	enjoyment of gaming plus the lovely nostalgia to the old days. The game can be played as a single player or multi-player and the
	game purpose is to reach the end as soon as possible.

	The goal of our game is to solve a sophisticated maze as fast as possible with the least possible attraction of soldiers. Both
	single and multi-player modes can plant a bomb and tries to keep the patrols out of your way or damage your enemy(in multi-player
	version). When the player reaches the end, he will receive bonus points with respect to remaining time. 

	Overview section includes more details about the content of the project. The report contains overview, functional requirements, 
	nonfunctional requirements and use case model chapters. The following chapter is overview that gives more information about
	the game.
