# INTRODUCTION

	The project group decides to implement an arcade game because arcade games has an advantage which is the models can be drawn 
	easily than the other programs. Thus, we decided to create a game which is combination of “Pacman" and “Bomberman”. We decided 
	to implement a stealth game "Maze Runner" that combines these two games and offers many new features. It will give you the 
	present enjoyment of gaming plus the lovely nostalgia to the old days. The game can be played as a single player or multi-player 
	and the game purpose is to reach the end as soon as possible.
	
	The goal of our game is to solve a sophisticated maze as fast as possible with the least possible attraction of soldiers. Both
	single and multi-player modes can plant a bomb and tries to keep the patrols out of your way or damage your enemy 
	(in multi-player version). When the player reaches the end, he will receive bonus points with respect to remaining time. 

	Overview section includes more details about the content of the project. The report contains overview, functional requirements, 
	nonfunctional requirements and use case model chapters. The following chapter is overview that gives more information about
	the game.
	
# Overview

	The game consists of a Pac-man like moving object which goal is to finish the maze as soon as possible without being killed by 
	the patrols which are continuosly moving around and trying to stop the player from reaching the exit of the maze. The player has 
	abilities that help him escape from the patrols when he is very close to them. The game has a time limit and also there are time 
	related features of the bombs. The game can be paused and continued where it was left afterwards. A high score system will be 
	accessible allowing the player to check his last five scores. In both single and multiplayer versions, the game will be played 
	by using the keyboard. Player can access the help menu to get instructions on how to play the game.
        
	2.1.  Play Mode
	
	Single player  mode: In the arcade mode the player’s goal is to reach to the exit as soon as possible. There will be the patrols 
	trying to stop him and the challenge is finishing the maze before the time ends. The player can get rid of the patrols by 
	throwing bombs to them but needs to escape in a short amount of time from the explosion range
	
	Multiplayer mode: In this the challenge is finishing before your opponent. The game is won from the player who made it first to 
	the exit or, if the time limit is up and none of the players makes it to the finish line, then the winner is the one who has 
	collected more points.
	
	2.2. Bomb
	Area:
	
		Own area: This kind of bomb is dropped in the current position of the player and has a small explosion area and the target 
	is the patrols. It has an explosion time of 2 seconds which is enough for the player to escape from the explosion range.
	
		Opponent area: This kind of bomb differs from the other type because it is used to kill your opponent and resets the 
	opponent’s position to the beginning position unless the opponent makes it away untouched.
	
	Usage ability: 
	
	Planting a bomb on his maze costs specific amount of points (100) but planting on the other side costs double(200).
	Each player has 200 points when “MazeRunner” starts and the score of the player increases as the time runs out such as gets 
	100 points in every 15 seconds. He can spend this points according to his position in the maze. For instance, in the 
	multi-player mode, if he is ahead of the other player, uses bombs to pass the patrols or if he is not ahead, uses bombs to 
	bring back his enemy to initial point unless the enemy gets away of the explosion rate on time.
	
	2.3. Time
	Limit: There will be a time limit to finish the game and it will vary from level to level. In the first level the time limit 
	is 1 minute 30 seconds. In the second level the time limit is 2 minutes 30 seconds and in the third level the time limit is 
	3 minutes 30 seconds.
	
	Bonus Score: When the game is done the remaining time in seconds will be multiplied by 10 and it will be added to the score.
	
	2.4 Patrols
	Blue: These patrols just move in one direction and they do not follow. They kill only if the player hits them.
	
	Yellow: These patrols move back and forth and they have the ability to follow the player when he is in a certain range.
	The player then has to escape or kill them in order to get rid of them.
