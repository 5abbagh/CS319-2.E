INTRODUCTION


	The project group decides to implement an arcade game because arcade games has an advantage which is the models can be drawn easily than the other programs. Thus, we decided to create a game which is combination of “Pacman" and “Bomberman”. We decided to implement a stealth game "Maze Runner" that combines these two games and offers many new features. It will give you the present enjoyment of gaming plus the lovely nostalgia to the old days. The game can be played as a single player or multi-player and the game purpose is to reach the end as soon as possible.

	The goal of our game is to solve a sophisticated maze as fast as possible with the least possible attraction of soldiers. Both single and multi-player modes can plant a bomb and tries to keep the patrols out of your way or damage your enemy(in multi-player version). When the player reaches the end, he will receive bonus points with respect to remaining time. 

	Overview section includes more details about the content of the project. The report contains overview, functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements and use case model chapters. The following chapter is overview that gives more information about the
the game.
