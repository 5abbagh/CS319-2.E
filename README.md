==================================

"The Game"

Our game will be a combination of Pecman and Bomberman, with additional features.

The game can be played in two modes: Single and multiplayer.

Players will start at a point in a maze, and they will try to reach the exit, in a time limit, facing enemies that will be of defferent abbilities: ones that only patrol in place, and others that follow the player if they saw it.

Players can avoid enemies by not getting too close, or by firing grenades at them.

At the time of playing, some boxes will appear, containing bonuses in time, health, or points.

When in multiplayer, when a player reaches a specific total point, the player will have the ability to plant a bomb near the other player which will make the other player try to avoid it by losing time or health.

The player that reaches the exit first is the winner.
