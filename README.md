## Project Description

Have you ever recalled childhood or past gaming memories?
Do you miss the old Atari games like Pacman and Bomberman?
Well, we offer you our racing yet stealth game "<b>Maze Runner</b>" that combines the two games and offers many new features. It will give you the present enjoyment of gaming plus the lovely nostalgia to the old days.

The runner will begin at a starting point in the maze, and will try to reach the exit, in a time limit, paying attention to patrols of soldiers. The runner can avoid patrols by not touching them, or by throwing grenades at them.
While playing, some boxes will appear in different places in the maze, containing bonuses in time, health or score.

The game can be also played in multiplayer mode, with two players using one keyboard.
The players will be playing in symmetric seperate mazes. In multiplayer the game becomes more difficult as it has the same previous instructions plus that the winner is the first player to reach the exit. When a player reaches a specific score, the player will have the ability to throw a grenade near the second player which will make the latter try to avoid it by escaping or otherwise getting injured (decreasing health).
